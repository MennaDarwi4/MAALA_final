C. Project Detailed Information 
Requirement Information 
1. Project Title 
Should be a clear and concise name that 
reflects the core of the project. 
English:  Multi-Agent Academic Learning Assistant (MAALA) 
Arabic:  المساعد الأكاديمي متعدد الوكلاء للطلاب 
2. Abstract (150-200 words) 
Brief overview of the project, including 
the problem being addressed, solution, 
and potential impact. 
University students often struggle to efficiently manage and comprehend 
large volumes of learning materials, including PDFs, research papers, 
educational videos, and online articles. Manually searching for relevant 
content, summarizing key concepts, and answering questions can be time-
consuming and cognitively demanding, which may negatively affect 
academic performance. The Multi-Agent Academic Learning Assistant 
(MAALA) addresses these challenges by integrating multiple intelligent 
agents into a unified platform. 
 
MAALA consists of three core agents: a PDF Explanation Agent that 
extracts and summarizes content from uploaded PDFs while providing 
question-answering capabilities; a Video and Website Summarization 
Agent that converts video speech to text and summarizes both video and 
web content using advanced language models such as Gamma and 
LLaMA; and a Search & Recommendation Agent that retrieves relevant 
educational resources using semantic search and LangChain-based tools. 
A central orchestrator coordinates these agents, consolidating outputs into 
a user-friendly dashboard for streamlined interaction. 
 
By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing 
techniques, MAALA significantly reduces the time and effort required for 
content comprehension, enhances knowledge retention, and supports 
personalized, multi-modal learning experiences. This project has the 
potential to improve students’ academic efficiency, provide scalable AI-
driven educational tools, and contribute to the growing EdTech ecosystem. 
 
3. Problem Statement (100-150 
words) 
-Detailed explanation of the problem the 
project addresses. 
-Why is it important from a technical and 
real-world perspective? 
Students today face an overwhelming amount of academic content spread 
across PDFs, research papers, online articles, and long educational videos. 
Manually extracting key ideas, connecting concepts, and finding relevant 
explanations often consumes hours of effort and leads to inefficient 
learning.  
Traditional study tools do not integrate multi-modal content processing, 
leaving students to juggle between separate applications for reading, 
summarizing, searching, and understanding complex topics. 
 
From a technical perspective, the lack of unified AI-driven systems that 
coordinate multiple specialized models creates a gap in delivering 
accurate, context-aware assistance. Real-world learners need tools that 
can automatically analyze, summarize, and answer questions across 
multiple formats. Addressing this problem is essential because it directly 
impacts students’ productivity, comprehension, and ability to prepare for 
exams effectively. A multi-agent AI system provides a scalable, intelligent 
solution capable of transforming raw content into clear, personalized 
learning guidance. 
 
4. Objectives (Bullet Points) 
-Clear and measurable goals of the 
project. 
-Break down into research, 
development, and implementation 
objectives. 
A. Research Objectives 
• Investigate multi-agent system architectures suitable for 
educational applications. 
• Analyze existing NLP models (LLaMA, Gamma) for performance in 
summarization, Q&A. 
• Study techniques for combining outputs from multiple agents 
through a central orchestrator. 
• Evaluate different embedding models and vector search methods 
for retrieving relevant content. 
 
B. Development Objectives 
• Build a PDF Agent capable of text extraction, summarization, and 
question answering. 
• Develop a Video/Website Agent that handles speech-to-text 
transcription and multi-modal summarization. 
• Implement a Search & Recommendation Agent for semantic 
search and resource retrieval. 
• Design a Central Orchestrator responsible for coordinating agents 
and merging results. 
• Create a unified user dashboard that visualizes summaries, 
answers, and recommended materials. 
 
C. Implementation Objectives 
• Integrate all agents into a single working system with smooth 
communication. 
• Optimize performance to ensure fast processing of long PDFs and 
videos. 
• Deploy the system as a functional prototype accessible to 
students. 
• Conduct user testing to measure usability, accuracy, and learning 
improvement. 
• Document the full workflow, models used, and the technical design 
for evaluation. 
 
 
5. Methodology (200-250 words) 
-Describe the technical approach, tools, 
frameworks, and algorithms used. 
-Justify why this approach was chosen. 
-Mention any relevant research papers or 
studies. 
 The proposed system uses a multi-agent architecture, where each agent is 
designed to handle a specific type of educational content.  
This specialization makes the system more accurate, efficient, and 
scalable. 
 
The PDF Agent extracts text using PyPDF2 and applies transformer-based 
models such as LLaMA or Gamma to generate summaries and answer 
student questions. 
 
 The Video/Website Agent uses Whisper to convert spoken content from 
YouTube videos into text, and the same summarization pipeline is applied 
to ensure consistent understanding across all content types. 
 
 The Search & Recommendation Agent uses sentence-transformer 
embeddings and vector search tools like FAISS or AstraDB Vector Search to 
find related PDFs, videos, and learning materials. 
 
A Central Orchestrator connects all agents, manages the workflow, and 
combines their outputs into a single, coherent response. This orchestrator 
is built with Python and FastAPI, using routing ideas inspired by LangChain. 
Students interact with the system through a simple dashboard created with 
Streamlit or React. 
 
This approach was chosen because multi-agent systems provide 
modularity and task specialization, which improves performance and 
makes the system easier to expand. Recent research—such as “LLM 
Agents: A Survey” (Zhao et al., 2024) and studies on retrieval-augmented 
generation—supports the effectiveness of coordinated agents for complex 
reasoning. Together, these methods enable accurate, context-aware 
learning assistance.
